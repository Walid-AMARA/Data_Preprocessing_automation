# Data_Preprocessing_automation
Automating quick data preprocessing with python Streamlit, pandas, Numpy, sklearn, scikit-learn and more.


So here's How You can use this beauty!

First of all this is a very good app for a quick prediction result to gain quick insight if someday your boss gave you a 20 minute deadline to get FRESH PREDICTIONS!

First is the Model building phase, where you upload your csv file, do all the data cleaning and build the model, when you download the model, it will download the one with the best acuracy. Now you have the model, Make sure you memorize exactly how you left the columns.

Second phase is the prediction phase. You upload both the csv dataset that you want to predict and the model you previously downloaded. You need to have the same columns that your model trained on, so make sure you trim your data accordingly.

Then you check the "Already have a model? Predict now", name your prediction feature and execute the model download the result CSV.
